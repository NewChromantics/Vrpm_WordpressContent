<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">VR for the travel industry?</span></h2>
Virtual Reality is making big waves across a number of industries as a new tool for marketing to and engaging with potential customers.   The travel industry is one industry that is set to benefit hugely from VR in a number of ways.

One of the ‘by-products’ of producing virtual reality tours of places is that you can view a 3D model either through an HMD (head mounted display) such as the Samsung Gear VR, or just navigate around the model on a normal 2D screen like an Ipad or smartphone.  When viewing through an HMD the wearer can really experience the full effect of virtual reality and get a much better impression of what a place is like without actually going there.  However not everybody has VR glasses to hand so being able to view the 3D model on a normal screen is a superb alternative.
<h3>More power to consumers with Virtual Reality</h3>
Sites like Expedia, Lastminute, Airbnb, Tripadvisor and Homeaway have given consumers the power to make their own decisions and craft their own trips how they like them.   VR tours of hotels, hotel rooms and self-catered holiday accommodation can now add the final level of detail that consumers need to make informed decisions.

<em>What is the place I am planning on sleeping actually like?  How big is it?  How is laid out?</em>

Tripadvisor itself can answer a lot of these questions but you have to trawl through other people’s bad photos or ‘management’ photos (which are detail light marketing shots) in order to make a reasonably informed decision.

Imagine if every hotel room, every holiday apartment, every self-catered villa or holiday cottage had a 3D tour?  One that that you could move around properly (not just single point 360 photos)?  Consumers could remove a massive level of doubt when they turn up to their holiday accommodation.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For those businesses who believe photos to be sufficient it simply begs the question ‘What are you hiding?’.</span>
