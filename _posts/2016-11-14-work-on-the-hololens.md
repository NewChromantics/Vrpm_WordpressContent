<h2>Creating a VRPM app for the Hololens</h2>
For the uninitiated the Microsoft Hololens is an augmented reality headset, Microsoft describe it as;

'Microsoft HoloLens is the first self-contained, holographic computer, enabling you to engage with your digital content and interact with holograms in the world around you.'

Anybody who has used the Hololens at all, even for the most basic demonstration cannot help but be impressed.   When we have shown people the most basic demonstration of putting say a digital elephant in a room, they have been blown away.  Firstly they are blown away because it is there and secondly because they can walk around the object.

However, what's really clever about the Hololens is it's ability to scan the environment it is in.  Because VRPM are obsessed with scanning and presenting 3D environments we thought why not use the Hololens?  Better still why not use the live streaming function and live stream building a 3D model of the environment you're in?

So, we did and it's pretty damn quick as you can see.

We're now going to release this as an app for use with the Hololens so you can quickly pull out a 3d model of where you are scanning and keep it, clean it, add texture to it....  Naturally this is just the first stage of the work we're doing and developing and we'll keep adding and updating this as augmented/mixed and virtual reality all start to occupy mainstream thinking.
