<h2>Why not show off what you've got?</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although pretty much everyone has now heard of VR most people have either a) never tried it or b) think it’s really expensive.  This is now changing.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Google and Samsung have pioneered low cost virtual reality headsets that most people with a smartphone can use from about £15.  The technology is everywhere right now and loads more content is being produced, which means millions more pairs of VR glasses and headsets will be out there. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Any small business with a premises they want to show off should seriously be considering organising a VR tour if they want to engage better with potential new customers.  A virtual reality capture offers a proper insight into a place, check out this capture of a local business..</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now we don’t think there’s a better way to show off a space, particularly if you have a pair of VR glasses around.  Try out one of these experiences and you can see what all the fuss is about.   </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our view is that if you have taken the time to make your business look as good as it can be then you should show it off to everyone.   </span>
