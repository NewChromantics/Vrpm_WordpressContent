<h2><strong>Why bother with Virtual Reality?</strong></h2>
I was an estate and letting agent for 15 years and when I first heard about virtual reality hitting the mainstream my first thoughts were how good this technology could be for estate agents.  It is so obvious to everyone but estate agents that people want to gain as much information they can prior to even doing a viewing.   Even though I’ve only really been working in VR for a short time the initial conversations with my contacts have all essentially gone the same way.

‘Yes this is so cool and I love it but you don’t want to show everyone everything’ – What possible reason could you have for not wanting to accurately portray the property you are marketing in order to gain more viewings?

‘Oh… yeah, the pictures and the floorplan make it look bigger/better than it really is and we want to encourage viewings’.

In my opinion the exact opposite is true.  Estate agents battle daily against the tide of opinion that people think they’re not being told the whole truth.   The best estate agents don’t need smoke and mirrors because they have a good relationship with their clients, they actually speak and engage with their applicants and their stock is on at the right price.
<h3><strong>Is it an industry disruptor? </strong></h3>
My view as an estate agent on virtual reality isn’t that it is going to fundamentally change the way people do business.  Nor is it going to change the way people decide which property to buy or rent.    What VR is going to do is give the actual consumer (not the client) the ability to see beyond a poorly written description and the artfully posed picture of a vase.  The applicant will be able see a place for what it is.    VR also levels the playing field.  As an estate agent I can tell you that for every one property that is a joy to photograph and present, there are five good properties that maybe the light wasn't right or the sofa is a horrible colour.  'The pictures just don't do the property justice' is a well worn phrase.

Unbelievably a lot of people make decisions based on furnishings that aren’t even there when they move in anyway.  This is where augmented reality can help but one tech at a time please.....
<h3><strong>How would you incorporate VR into your business?</strong></h3>
In the first instance if I had an estate agency now I would ‘set up’ my agency with a set of VR glasses or two in each office for less than £200,  then make sure that all my new properties had a VR presentation made and go from there.  Oddly enough the agents that I would consider ‘old school’ actually see these office presentations as a way of encouraging people to come to the office and speak to them.    I would say that though, I’m an estate agent with a VR company.

In my opinion estate and letting agents need to look properly towards the future.  I don’t mean the battle between online agents or the need for electronic conveyancing but understand that the consumer today wants information and lots of it.
