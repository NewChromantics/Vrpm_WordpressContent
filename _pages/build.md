    <h1>Virtual Reality for pre-build</h1>
    VRPM can build perfectly rendered photo realistic virtual reality spaces for use with any kind of VR equipment.  Depending on how the unbuilt space or property is going to be presented VRPM can build a virtual reality presentation to suit the client.
    
    We have partnered with a highly regarded architectural visualisation firm in order to provide what will be essential service for Developers, New Homes sales and Overseas Property Investors.
    
    The ability to accurately present exactly what a building will look like both inside and out before it has been built is a powerful tool.  With accurate 3D visualisation of a building from the outside and then a virtual reality tour inside, anyone buying something off-plan can make a more informed decision.

    <h2>VRPM can build you an app</h2>
    &nbsp;
    
    If you want to show your virtual reality presentations regularly and share them with potential clients then VRPM will build you an app.
