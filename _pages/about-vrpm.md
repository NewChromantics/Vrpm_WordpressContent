    <h1>Why VR for property?</h1>
    VRPM was started because of a shared opinion that there is a better way to view property than just photographs, floor plans and blurb.
    
    Once experienced, VR becomes obvious for property as virtual reality enhances every situation where a photo is used for property marketing. The ability to be able to get a real sense of space and volume without having to go there can help to reinforce and make decisions.
